# Adaptive Fuzzy PID
Adaptive Fuzzy PID (AFPID) is a powerful Arduino library designed specifically to enhance the control performance of speed for DC motors. By incorporating adaptive and fuzzy logic techniques, AFPID dynamically adjusts the PID parameters in real-time, allowing for precise and efficient motor speed control. With its intelligent algorithm, this library enables Arduino-based systems to achieve superior control accuracy and responsiveness, revolutionizing the way DC motors are controlled and opening up new possibilities for various applications.
